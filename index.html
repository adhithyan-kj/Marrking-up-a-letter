  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

  <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD (<abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr>) next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however, it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><time datetime="2016-09-01">First semester: 1 September 2016</time></li>
    <li><time datetime="2017-01-15">Second semester: 15 January 2017</time></li>
    <li><time datetime="2017-05-02">Third semester: 2 May 2017</time></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
  <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com" title="Important university dates">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Your interests in the following areas are noted:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>&deg;</sup>C (85<sup>&deg;</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
    <li>HTML (<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) and CSS (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We look forward to seeing how you will develop your ideas, and will provide you with all the support you need, including full access to our library, and computing facilities including dedicated access to the science faculty's 24-core server.</p>

  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>Yes, you are right! As part of our post doctorate student initiative, we hold a weekly dance-off. You will be eligible to compete once you have completed induction and the necessary health and safety training.</p>
  <p>We have quite a few dancers on our team who specialize in the following moves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Atomic Temptation</li>
    <li>Elvis Pelvis</li>
    <li>Spin Cycle</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So, I hope that answers your questions. If not, feel free to email me at <strong>no_reply@example.com</strong>.</p>
  <p>All the best,</p>
